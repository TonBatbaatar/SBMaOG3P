```

Note: Since the return variables are named based on the function name, I assumed you meant to name the function `func` and the return values as `res0`. If that's not the case, please replace `func` with the desired function name and adjust the return variables accordingly.

Function name is not mentioned, but since the problem description asked for a Python function with the given naming convention, let's assume the function name is `func`."
DoubleLetters," ```python
def func(in0):
 multiplier_map = {""!"": 3, """": 2}
 res0 = """"
 for char in in0:
 if char.isalpha():
 res0 += char * multiplier_map.get(char, 1)
 elif char in multiplier_map:
 res0 += char * multiplier_map[char]
 else:
 res0 += char
 return res0
```

Note that in this solution, the function accepts only one string argument as `in0` and returns the result as `res0`. In the provided problem description, the parameter names were not strictly adhered to, so I assumed `inX` for input and `resX` for result. If you want to stick to the naming convention given in the problem description, you can rename the variables accordingly.

The function uses a dictionary called `multiplier_map` to store the multipliers for letters and exclamation points. The default value for the `get` method is `1`, which will be applied to non-alphabetic and non-exclamation characters."
CollatzNumbers," ```python
def collatz_length(in0):
 def collatz(n):
 if n % 2 == 0:
 return 1 + collatz(n // 2)
 else:
 return 1 + collatz(3 * n + 1)
 return collatz(abs(in0))
```
This function, named `collatz_length`, takes a single integer parameter `in0` and returns an integer `res0` representing the length of the Collatz sequence starting from that integer. It uses a helper function `collatz` to compute the sequence itself. Note that the helper function is defined within the main function as a nested function to save space. The `abs` function is used to ensure that the input is positive, since the Collatz sequence is defined for positive integers only."
ReplaceSpacewithNewline," ```python
def in0_to_res0(in0):
    res0 = in0.replace("" "", ""\n"")
    res1 = sum(1 for char in in0 if not char.isspace())
    return res0, res1
```
This function, named `in0_to_res0`, takes a single string parameter `in0`. It returns a tuple containing two values: the string `res0`, which is the input string with spaces replaced by newlines, and the integer `res1`, which is the count of non-whitespace characters in the input string."
EvenSquares," ```python
def is_perfect_square(n):
    return int(import math, sqrt(n))**2 == n

def in0(n):
    return [i for i in range(0, n) if is_perfect_square(i) and i > 0 and i % 2 == 0]

in0(20)
```

This solution consists of two functions: `is_perfect_square` and `in0`. `is_perfect_square` is a helper function that checks if a given number is a perfect square. `in0` is the main function that returns a list of all positive even perfect squares less than `n`.

However, the problem description asked for a single Python function with parameters `in0` and `res0` (or similar naming conventions). Here's an alternative single-function solution, but please note that it's not as efficient as the provided two-function solution:

```python
import math

def in0(n, res0=[]):
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % (i*i) == 0 and i*i % 2 == 0:
            res0.append(i*i)
            yield res0[-1]
```

This single-function solution uses a generator instead of a list to store the results. It also checks for perfect squares within the square root of `n` since perfect squares cannot be larger than the square root of `n`."
WallisPi,"```python
def wallis_product(in0, res0=0.0):
    for i in range(2, in0+1):
        res0 += ((i-2)/i)*((i)/(i-1))
    return round(res0*(1+((4/(8*i-1))+(2/(8*i+1)))*(3*(i&1) + 1)/512), 5)
```

This function takes an integer input `in0` and returns an approximation of the Wallis product out to `in0` terms, rounded to 5 decimal places. The result is stored in the variable `res0`."
StringLengthsBackwards," ```python
def func(in0):
    return [len(s) for s in reversed(in0)]
```

This function, named `func`, takes one parameter `in0` which is a list of strings and returns a list `res0` with the length of each string in reversed order."

CountOdds," ```python
def odd_count(in0):
 res0 = 0
 while in0:
  if in0 % 2:
   res0 += 1
  in0 = in0 // 2
 return res0
```
This function, named `odd_count`, takes a single integer as its parameter, named `in0`. It returns the number of odd integers in the given integer, without using any specific even or odd instruction. The return variable is named `res0`.

The function uses a while loop to keep processing the integer until it becomes zero. Inside the loop, it checks if the integer is odd by using the modulo operator `%` to check the remainder after division by 2. If the remainder is non-zero, it increments the return variable `res0`. Then, it divides the integer by 2 to process the next integer in the vector (as if it were a vector of integers). Once the integer becomes zero, the function returns the count of odd integers in `res0`."
MirrorImage," ```python
def reverse_vectors(in0, in1):
 res0 = in0[-1:]*10**len(in0) + sum(int(digit)*10**i for i, digit in enumerate(reversed(str(in1)[::-1])))
 return res0 == in1 or res0 == in0
```
This function takes two lists `in0` and `in1` as input and returns a single value `res0`. It checks if one of the input lists is the reverse of the other by converting them to strings, reversing the string of one of them, and then converting it back to a number. If the numbers are equal to each other or to their reversed versions, then they are reverse vectors of each other and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. Note that this solution assumes that the input vectors have the same length."
SuperAnagrams," ```python
def super_anagram(in0, in1):
 distinguisher = set(in0)
 for char in in1:
 if char not in distinguisher:
 return False
 distinguisher -= {char for char in in0 if char == char}
 return len(distinguisher) == 0
```

This function takes two strings, `in0` and `in1`, as input, and returns a Boolean value, `res0`. It determines whether the string `in1` is a super anagram of the string `in0`. To accomplish this, it converts the characters of the string `in0` into a set called `distinguisher`, which stores unique characters from `in0`. Then, for each character in `in1`, it checks if the character is in `distinguisher`. If the character is not in `distinguisher`, then the function returns `False`. After checking all characters in `in1`, if `distinguisher` still has any elements left, then the function returns `False`. Otherwise, if `distinguisher` is empty, then the function returns `True`."
SumofSquares," ```python
def sum_of_squares(in0 as n):
 for i in range(1, n+1))):
 res0 += i * i
```

Note: In Python, function names don't have to follow the convention of having `in` for inputs and `out` or `res` for outputs. However, for the sake of following your naming convention, I've named the input as `in0` (`n`) and the return value as `res0`.

Also, Python uses parentheses to define a function and does not require a return statement if the function only returns a single expression. In this case, the expression being returned is the result of the sum of squares calculation."
VectorsSummed," ```python
def add_vectors(in0, in1):
    res0 = [0] * len(in0)
    for i in range(len(in0)):
        res0[i] = in0[i] + in1[i]
    return res0
```"
X-WordLines," ```python
def wrap(in0, in1):
 def word_split(text): return [word.strip() for word in text.split() if word]
 def line_fill(text, x): return text + (' '*(x - (len(text.split()) % x)) if x else '')
 lines = [line_fill(' '.join(word_split(text[i:i+50])), in0) for i in range(0, len(in1), 50)]
 return '\n'.join(lines) if in1 else ''

in0, in1 = map(int, input().split())
 res0 = wrap(in0, in1)
```

This function `wrap` takes two parameters: `in0` for the number of words per line and `in1` for the input string. The function first defines two helper functions: `word_split` and `line_fill`. `word_split` is used to split the input string into a list of words, and `line_fill` is used to fill the line with spaces to ensure exactly `in0` number of words per line. The main logic is in the list comprehension inside the `wrap` function, where it splits the input string into lines of maximum 50 words each, and applies the `line_fill` function to fill the words to the desired number. Finally, it returns the list of lines joined by newline character if the input string is not empty. Note that this solution assumes the input string is not too large and can be easily split into 50-word chunks in memory."

 res0 = 0
 for char in in0 + in1:
 if char in Scrabble_scores:
 res0 += Scrabble_scores[char]
 return res0
```
This function takes two string parameters `in0` and `in1` and returns the Scrabble score as an integer `res0`. The Scrabble scores for each letter are stored in a dictionary `Scrabble_scores`. The function iterates through each character in the combined string of `in0` and `in1`, adds the score of each letter to the `res0` variable, and finally returns the total Scrabble score."
WordStats," ```python
def process_text(in0):

    sentance_terminators = [""."", ""!"", ""?""]
    sentences = len(filter(lambda x: x[-1] in sentance_terminators, words)) + 1
    avg_sentence_length = len(words) / sum(len(filter(lambda x: x in sentance_terminators, words)) * sentences)
    res1 = sentences
    res2 = avg_sentence_length
    return res0, res1, res2
```
This function takes a single string argument `in0` and returns a tuple containing three variables: `res0`, `res1`, and `res2`. The elements of the tuple represent the number of words containing each length from 1 to the length of the longest word, the number of sentences, and the average sentence length respectively."
Checksum," ```python
def checksum(in0):
    res0 = sum(ord(c) for c in in0) % 64 + 32
    return chr(res0)
```

Here's the function with the given constraints:

1. Function name is not provided, so I named it `checksum`.
2. The function takes one parameter named `in0`.
3. The function returns one value named `res0`.
4. The function converts the input string character by character into their ASCII values, sums them up, takes the sum modulo 64, adds 32, and then converts the resulting integer back into a character.
5. The character returned is the checksum character."
Digits," ```python

 num = -num
 while num > 0:
 digits.append(num % 10)
 num //= 10
 return digits + [−5] if in0 < 0 else digits
 return digit_helper(in0)
```

This function, named `digit_list`, accepts a single integer as an argument, `in0`. It returns a list of the digits in the given integer, starting with the most significant digit. For a negative integer, the negative sign is appended to the least significant digit. The helper function `digit_helper` is defined inside the main function. It processes the integer by extracting its digits one by one and appending them to a list. If the given integer is negative, the negative sign is added to the list before returning it."

    return res0[in4-in0<=in0 and in4-in1<=in1 and in4-in2<=in2 and in4-in3<=in3 and in4-in4<=in4]
```
This function takes 5 parameters named `in0`, `in1`, `in2`, `in3`, `in4` and returns a string `res0`, `res1`, `res2`, `res3`, `res4` with the corresponding letter grade. The comparison inside the function uses the given thresholds to determine the grade."
